# Attack Replay


### Summary

The goal of **Attack Replay** is to spread security knowledge by demystifying common and well known security vulnerabilities. For each security vulnerability in this project, Attack Replay:

* Shows how to easily recreate the vulnerable environment
* Provides an exploit with instructions on how to run the exploit against the vulnerable environment
* And explains the _how_ and _why_ behind the vulnerability


### Purpose

Attack Replay aims to make security vulnerabilities more understandable to the average developer in hopes that if the developers learn the _why_ behind the vulnerability, they are less likely to write vulnerable sotftware in the future.

### Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome! Please follow the template defined [here](/_template/README.md) for creating attack replays for new vulnerabilities.

Here are some popular vulnerabilities that could use an attack replay for them:

* Dirty Cow
* Heartbleed
* Shellshock
* Drown
* Badlock
* Ghost
